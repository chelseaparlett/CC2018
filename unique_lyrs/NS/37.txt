Bring in the noise Bring down the house We came here to turn the party out
Say c'mon c'mon lets raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all
 Bring in the noise Bring down the house We came here to turn the party out
Say c'mon c'mon lets raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all

We need to get down
The scene is so so right Everybody's in the house tonight Loose your mind
Let your body take control You've got that feeling in your soul

I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy And all I want to do is hit the floor I want to shout it though So make it louder y'all
And turn it up some more.
 Bring in the noise Bring down the house We came here to turn the party out
Say c'mon c'mon lets raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all
 Bring in the noise Bring in the noise 
Just shake it girl
And enjoy the ride
Do what you feel inside 'Cause it's your world All you wanted more
So baby go and get yours 
I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy And all I want to do is hit the floor I want to shout it y'all
So make it louder y'all
And turn it up some more
 Bring in the noise Bring down the house We came here to turn the party out
Say c'mon c'mon lets raise the roof
And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all
 Bring in the noise [Repeat: x4]

I've got that feeling baby
You know it drives me crazy And all I want to do is hit the floor
