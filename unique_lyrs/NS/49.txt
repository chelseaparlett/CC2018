Could it be you? 
I've been searching so hard to find 
Tell me how could I have been so blind 
You were here all the time 
(You were here all the time)  Could it be you? 

You never looked as good to me 
As you look tonight, oh yeah 
It's like I've seen you for the first time  Through a lover's eyes 
How could it be that I never knew? 
It's always been you that I've been looking for 

You were always right here by my side, oh yeah  Could it be you? 
I've been searching so hard to find 
Tell me how could I have been so blind 
You were here all the time, oh yeah  Could it be you? 

The girl I've always had dreams about 
The one I just can't live without 
Is it so? Tell me now 
(Please tell me)  Could it be you?  Could you imagine what it's like? 

To always live without love 
I need to have you in my life 
I think I know that now 
My open heart will make you a part 
A part of this love I've been keeping 
And I might just give it all to you, oh 
 Could it be you? 
I've been searching so hard to find 
Tell me how could I have been so blind 
You were here all the time  Could it be you? 
The girl I've always had dreams about 

The one I just can't live without 
Is it so? Tell me now  Every girl I meet  Though they might be sweet 
They can't compare to you 
So I search no more 

'Cause what I've been looking for 
I know I've found in you  Could it be you? 
I've been searching so hard to find 
Tell me how could I have been so blind 
You were here all the time 
 Could it be you? 
The girl I've always had dreams about 
The one I just can't live without 
Is it so? Tell me now  Could it be you
