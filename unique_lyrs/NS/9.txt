Well it's not far down to paradise 
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility 
Oh, the canvas can do miracles 
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me, oh

It's not far to Never Never Land
No reason to pretend 
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles 
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me, oh
 Sailing (takes me away) Takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
(I heard it could be)
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
(Soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free, yeah

Fantasy, it gets the best of me
When I'm sailing, sailing 
All the world in a reverie  Every word is a symphony 
Won't you believe me, oh
 Sailing (takes me away)
(Takes me away) Takes me away to where I want to be
(To where I've always heard it could be)
(I heard it could be)
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
(Soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free

Well it's not far back to sanity 
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity 
Oh, the canvas can do miracles 
Just you wait and see
Baby believe me, oh
 Sailing (takes me away) Takes me away
(To where I've always heard it could be)
I heard it could be
(Heard it could be)
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
(Soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free, free

(Sailing takes me away)
(To where I've always heard it could be)
I heard it could be
(I heard it could be)
Just a dream and a wind to carry me
(Soon I will be free)
Soon I will be free, yeah
