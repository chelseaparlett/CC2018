I woke up this morning and the sun was gone Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song Closed my eyes and I slipped away
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(More than a feeling)
(More than a feeling)
Well it's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
Till I see Mary Ann walk away

When I'm tired and I think I'm cold
I hide in my music and forget the day
And dream of a girl that I used to know Close my eyes and she slipped away
Ooh, ooh, ooh

(More than a feeling)
(More than a feeling)
Well it's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
Till I see Mary Ann walk away

Well it's more than a feeling 
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
Till I see Mary Ann walk away
 Close my eyes and slip away
