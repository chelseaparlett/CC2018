It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

(Hey, yeah)
Baby I don't understand 
Just why we can't be lovers  Things are getting out of hand Trying too much, but baby we can't win

Let it go
If you want me girl, let me know
I am down, on my knees 
I can't take it anymore 

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

(Ooh, alright)
Baby don't mis-understand (don't misunderstand)
What I'm trying to tell ya
In the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
Baby, it feels like we're running out of time

Let it go
If you want me girl, let me know
I am down, on my knees 
I can't take it anymore 

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul (alright)
We're apart I feel it too (I feel it too)
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
