And baby, baby you can see me

We can get together naturally 
(We can) We can get together on the digital screen 
 Every time I'm sittin' home alone girl 
I can't wait to get you on the phone girl 
So, pick it up, babe 
I can see everything you do 
Bouncin' me from satellite to satellite 
I love the things you do for me so late tonight 
So turn me on, yeah 
It's like I'm right there next to you, yeah 

[Chorus 2] 
Can we get connected? 
I need some love and affection, baby 
I'll call you on the phone 
I hope that I get through 
If you're in the mood and on the phone, 
here's what you do: leave a message 
You know the kind I like to get back to 

[Chorus 1] 

Yeah 

I lose my mind just when you're speaking 
I see you on the screen, I get to freaking 
So, get down, babe 
And I'll get down for you 
I get so excited when I'm watching, girl 
I can't wait to see you touch your body, girl 
It's just me and you 
So, we can do what we gotta do (yeah)
