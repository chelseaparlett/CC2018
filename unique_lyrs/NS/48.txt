Oh, oh
When the visions around you Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength 
I'll give you hope Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing there all along 

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong 
Til' the day my life is through 
This I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever 
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never 
Will you hurt anymore 
I give you my word
I give you my heart 
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow Forever has now begun 

Just close your eyes (close your eyes)each loving day (each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away (no)
Til' the day my life is through 
This I promise you
This I promise you

Over and over I thought 
When I hear you call Without you in my life, baby
I just wouldn't be living at all

And I will take you in my arms (I will take you in my arms)
And hold you right where you belong (right where you belong)
Til' the day my life is through 
This I promise you, babe

Just close your eyes each loving day (each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away (no) Every word I say is true
This I promise you
 Every word I say is true
This I promise you
Ooh, I promise you
