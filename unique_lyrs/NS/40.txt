Do-do-do [Repeats]

She was my once in a lifetime,  Happy ending come true. 
Oh, I guess I should have told her, 
I thought she knew

Do-do-do,
She said I took her for granted, 
That's the last thing I would do. 
Whoa, I'll never understand it,  Cause I thought she knew. 
I thought she knew: 
My world revolved around her, 
My love light burned for her alone. 
But she couldn't see the flame, 
Only myself to blame. 
I should've known, 
I should've known. 

A heart full of words left unspoken 
Now that we're through 
I'd sell my soul "to have this silence broken" 
I thought she knew my world revolved around her 
My love light burned for her alone 
But she couldn't see the flame 
Only myself to blame 
I should've known 
I should've known 

She was my once in a lifetime,  Happy ending come true. 
Whoa,
I guess I should of told her, 
But I thought she knew. 
I thought she knew, 
I thought she knew

I though that, she, knew,
Yeah
