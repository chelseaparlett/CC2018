How can I say that I love you
When you're so far away
So tell me why you had to go
Was it me, I need to know

What can I do to make you see
That I'm here, here for you
I really hope that you'll come home
So we can be together again

What can I do (What can I do)
To make you see (To make you see)
That I'm here (I'm here)
Here for you (I'm here for you)
I really hope (I really hope)
That you'll come home (That you'll come home)
So we can be (So we can be) Together again (Together again)

Ooh...together again 
Ooh...together again
