Can this be true?
Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete 
I thought I was whole 
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel?
It's a miracle 

Your love is like a river  Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret 
That I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must have spent 
A little more time
On you
(A little more time, yes he did baby)

In all of creation, all things great and small 
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl 
They broke the mold when you came in this world 

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without 
The warmth of your smile 
The heart of a child 
That's deep inside  Leaves me purified 

Your love is like a river  Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret 
That I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must have spent 
A little more time
On you

(On you, on you, on you, you)
(On you, on you, on you, you)
(On you, on you, on you, you)
(On you, on you, on you, you)
 Never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel?
It's a miracle 

Your love is like a river  Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret 
That I never could keep
When I look into your eyes
I know that it's true
God must have spent 
A little more time
On you

(On you, on you, on you, you)
God must have spent 
A little more time, on you
(on you, on you, you, you, oh yeah)
A little more time
On you
