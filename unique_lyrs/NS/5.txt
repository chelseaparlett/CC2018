Lying in your arms
So close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn Cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
 Where was my head Where was my heart 
Now I cry alone in the dark

I lie awake 
I drive myself crazy  Drive myself crazy  Thinking of you
Made a mistake 
When I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy  Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

I was such a fool
I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
You confessed your love Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free

And now I'm left
With all this pain
I've only got myself to blame 

I lie awake 
I drive myself crazy  Drive myself crazy  Thinking of you
Made a mistake 
When I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy  Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

Why didn't I know it
(How much I loved you baby)
Why couldn't I show it
(If I had only told you)
When I had the chance 
Oh I had the chance 

I lie awake 
I drive myself crazy  Drive myself crazy  Thinking of you
Made a mistake 
When I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy  Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

I lie awake 
I drive myself crazy  Drive myself crazy  Thinking of you
Made a mistake 
When I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy  Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)
