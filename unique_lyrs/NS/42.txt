I was hanging with the fellas 
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous 
I was hoping that I'd never see you with him 
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him 
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none 
And I can tell by looking that he's not the one 
He's not the type you said you liked 
His style is wack, clothes are bad 
Come on, girl, let him go 
I want you back 

Call me a hater, if you want to 
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you 
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like 
But you without me ain't right 
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to 
That's true, I'm crazy 'bout you 
You could say I'm breakin' down inside 
'Cause I can't see you with another guy 

[Chorus] 
It makes me ill 
To see you give 
Love and attention at his will 
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel 
To see you with him 
Oh, it makes me ill 
To see you give 
Love and attention at his will 
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel 
To see you with him 

Girl I know that we broke up 
But that doesn't mean you should give the cold shoulder 
'Cause you know that I truly do adore ya 
And that other guy can't do nothin' for ya 
See,
I can tell that you don't really love that guy 
But there's no need for you to go and waste your time 
I think you know I love ya more 
Girl you gotta let him go 
I want you so just give him the boot 

Call me a hater, if you want to 
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you 
You can say I'm trippin' if you feel like 
But you without me ain't right 
You can say I'm crazy, if you want to 
That's true-- I'm crazy 'bout you 
You could say I'm breakin' down inside 
'Cause I can't see you with another guy 

[Chorus] 

Oh
It makes me ill cause you used to be my girl 
Used to be (my girl) Used to be my girl yeah
It makes me ill (oh) cause you used to be my girl (c'mon) 
My girl 
So baby come back to me (baby) 

It makes me ill 
To see you give 
Love and attention at his will (at his will) 
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel 
To see you with him (when I see you with him) 
Oh, it makes me ill (baby I'm jealous) 
To see you give 
Love and attention at his will (at his will) 
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel 
To see you with him 

Oh it makes me ill 
To see you give 
Love and attention at his will 
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel 
To see you with him (you can't imagine how it makes me feel) 

What? We done and done it again! Mercy oh!
