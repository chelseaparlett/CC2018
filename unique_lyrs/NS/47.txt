When winter comes in summer 
When there's no more forever 
Yeah, that's when I'll stop loving you

That's when I'll stop loving you
I'm sure you've heard these words before
And I know it's hard for you to trust them once more
You're afraid it all might end
And a broken heart is scared of breaking again
But you've gotta believe me
I'll never leave you
You'll never cry long as I am there 
And I will always be there 
You will never be without love

When winter comes in summer 
When there's no more forever 
When lies become the truth 
Oh you know then baby,
That's when I'll stop lovin'
That's when I'll stop loving you

That's when I'll stop loving you yeah

As long as sunlight lights the sky Light of love will be found in these eyes of mine (these eyes of mine)
And I will shine that light for you
You're the only one, I'll ever give this heart to
What I'm trying to say is, nothing will change this (ahh..)
There'll be no time you won't find me there (find me there) Cause I will always be there 
You will always have all my love

When winter comes in summer 
When there's no more forever (yeah)
When lies become the truth (oh)
Well you know then baby,
That's when I'll stop lovin'
That's when I'll stop loving you

That's when I'll stop loving you

And when this world doesn't turn anymore 
When the stars all decide to stop shining 
Til then I'm gonna to be by your side Gonna be loving you forever  Every day of my life

Oh baby
