Oh I'll be good for you baby 
Yeah oh 

[Chorus]
I'll be good for you 
I ain't gonna take my love away 
And I'ma love you more girl every day 
I'll be good for you 
Baby girl it's plain to see 
That our love was meant to be yeah 

I know your heart's anticipating 
And my love is on your mind 
Well don't you worry I won't keep you waiting  Cause I ain't never seen a lady so fine yeah 

I know you want me to 
It's in your eyes 
They say you do 
They're telling me you'll open up your heart to me, yeah  Cause if you want me to 
I'll sacrifice my world for you 
And show you the way love's supposed to be, yeah 

[Chorus]

Now I know you think I must be faking 
I promised all these things right from the start 
So don't you rush into the situation  Cause I just wrote this song to tell you my heart, ooh 

I want to be with you 
And girl there's nothing I won't do 
To make you see this is where you should be  Cause baby we can do anything you want to do 
Girl I want to be a part of your fantasy 

[Chorus] 

Ooh yeah oh I'll be good for you baby 
I can be good for you 
Tell me what you want to do 
Baby girl it's plain to see 
That our love was meant to me 
(I'll be good for you) 

I can be good for you 
Tell me what you want to do 
Baby girl it's plain to see 
That our love was meant to me 
(I'll be good for you) 

I can be good for you 
Tell me what you want to do 
Baby girl it's plain to see 
That our love was meant to me 
(I'll be good for you) 

I can be good for you 
Tell me what you want to do 
Baby girl it's plain to see 
That our love was meant to me 
(I'll be good for you) 

I can be good for you 
Tell me what you want to do 
Baby girl it's plain to see 
That our love was meant to me 
(I'll be good for you) 

[Chorus]
