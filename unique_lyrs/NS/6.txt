I wanna drown in your love, lead me to your water 
Let it flow (let it flow), just let it flow baby
My love is insane, pleasure and pain (pain)
It's part of life, so live it up baby (live it up baby)
Now if you're scared of love, don't, don't, don't be afraid 
'Cause girl I'm scared too, but I gotta have you Gonna love you day and night, yes I'll treat you right!
