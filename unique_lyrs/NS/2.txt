You drive a pretty car, you know how fine you are
And nobody needs to say it, no way
They love the clothes you wear, they compliment you and I
Just love the way you play it

But the only thing you dream of, money can't buy for you
And in my dreams I make your wish come true

For the girl who has everything 
I bring you love
I bring you love
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough 
Of my love

Why do you run and hide?
Say what you feel inside (say what you feel)
Why must you always fake it? (oh yeah)
Girl you need to understand 
Your heart is safe within my hands and
I promise I'll never break it oh

I know that you still dream of what money can't buy for you
And in my dreams I'll make your wish come true

For the girl who has everything 
I bring you love
I bring you love
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough 
Of my love

If you just let me try, (my baby listen)
I'll help you find (what you've been missing)
You gotta listen to your heart (and not your mind)
Oh baby yeah

For the girl who has everything (everything)
I bring you love (I bring you love)
I bring you love (I bring you love)
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough 
My love (of my love)
For the girl who has everything (I can't, 'cause you want my love )
I bring you love (And I'm gonna give it to ya)
I bring you love
'Cause the girl who has everything can't get enough
