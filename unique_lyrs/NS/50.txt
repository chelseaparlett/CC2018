If I'm not the one you want 
Take your time to figure out 
I'm staring at your picture every night 
The scent of you still lingers in my mind 
I wonder if you'll only feel alright 
And the sun has come out of the clouds 
And sometimes when I listen to our song 
The night seems so cold and far too long 
I want to call you up 'cause in the end 
I keep writing letters to my garbage can  Lately it feels like I'm goin' crazy 
Baby come and lay down beside me 
If I'm not the one you want 
Who's he 
Take your time to figure out 
You'll see 
If I'm not the one you want 
Then maybe 
I'll be the one you need 
I feel like it's on you I can depend 
Wish I could turn back the hands of time  Enough of building castles in the sand 
Why can't we be forever  Lately it feels like I'm goin' crazy 
Baby come and lay down beside me 
If I'm not the one you want 
Then who's he 
Take your time to figure out 
You'll see 
If I'm not the one you want 
Then maybe 
I'll be the one you need 
If I'm not the one you want 
Then who's he 
Take your time to figure out 
You'll see 
If I'm not the one you want 
Then maybe 
I'll be the one you need

Somewhere, in the back of my mind 
I know that you will be mine 
Somehow, I wish I could rewind  Leave all the worries behind 

If I'm not the one you want, I'll be the one you need 
Take your time to figure out 
I'll be the one you need 

If I'm not the one you want 
Then who's he 
Take your time to figure out 
And you'll see 
If I'm not the one you want 
Then maybe 
I'll be the one you need 

I'll be the one you need
