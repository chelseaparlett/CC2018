It's gonna--be--me
Oh, yeah

You might been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry Maybe that's why
 Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you
You don't want to lose it again 
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally 
Get to love somebody  Guess what
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know There ain't no time to waste 
So just you're just too blind, to see
But in the end, ya know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why
 Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you
You don't want to lose it again 
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally 
Get to love somebody (somebody) Guess what (guess what)
It's gonna be me

It's gonna be me
Oh yeah
 There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see

It's gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna
Justin: It's gonna be me
All that I do is not enough for you
Don't want to lose it
But I'm not like that
When finally (finally)
You get to love Guess what? (guess what?)
It's gonna be me
 Every little thing I do Never seems enough for you (for you babe)
You don't want to lose it again (don't want to lose it)
But I'm not like them
