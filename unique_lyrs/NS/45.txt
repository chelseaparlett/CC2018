Baby, you're not the only one
I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through 
If I see what's really going on Staying out at night  While you're by the phone 

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned 
Even the good guys get burned 
Take it from me
See, I would give you love
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of

Baby, you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it here's my heart 
No strings attached

He doesn't give you the kind of attention 
That a girl like you needs (that a girl like you needs)
'cause he always looks around 
His eyes wander around
He doesn't see you like I see

Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned 
Even the good guys get burned 
Take it from me
Baby, I would give you love
The kind of love that you'd only dreamed of

Baby, you're not the only one (baby, you're not the only one)
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love (to fall in love)
And I know that you've hurt in the past (hurt in the past)
If you want it here's my heart (here's my heart)
No strings attached

Take it from me
