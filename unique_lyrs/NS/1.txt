You sheltered me from harm
You kept me warm, you kept me warm
And you gave my life to me
You set me free, you set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

And I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again 

You taught me how to love
What it's of, what it's of
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

And I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, and my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again 

Is there someone you know
You're loving them so
But taking them all for granted 
You may lose them one day Someone takes them away
And they don't hear the words you long to say

Yeah
Give up my life, give up my heart  Everything I own

You know, baby
My love for you will always be true
That's right  Because there is no me without you

I would give everything I own Everything I own Nobody can love you, like I do

And I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again 
Just to have you back again
