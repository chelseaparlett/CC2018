Snowy Night  Where it's warm here by the fire
Here with you (here with you)
I have all that I desire 
It's been a long year
But somehow we got by
Now it's Christmas Eve
And love is on our side
I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothin' else will do,
All I want is you this Christmas 
 Children sing (children sing) Christmas carols at our door Spreading joy, (spreading joy)
That's what Christmas time is for Though we don't have much
You've got me and I've got you
And with a little faith Miracles come true

And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothin' else will do,
All I want is you this Christmas 

I don't want the love any other girl 
I want only thing in this whole wide world  Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas 
 Cheek to cheek 
The lights are low 
A kiss beneath the mistletoe 
Your face lit by the fire's glow That's all I want tonight 
And I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree
Don't you know the best thing you could give to me
Nothin' else will do,
All I want is you this Christmas  Nothing else will do
All I want is you this Christmas
