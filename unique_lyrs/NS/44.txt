Thank God that it's Friday night and I
Just-just-just-just-just got paid
Yea, Oh

Just got paid Friday night

Just got paid, Friday night
Party's hoppin', place is right  Booties shaking, all around 
Pump that jam, while I'm getting down
 Check the mirror, I'm lookin' fly Round up the posse, jump in my ride Radio rockin', smooth jams
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound 
I'm feelin' good don't you know I'm grooving 
To the beat
I'm groovin', yea, grooving, oh oh oh oh

Just got paid, Friday night
Party's hoppin', place is right  Booties shaking, all around 
Pump that jam, while I'm getting down

Some say my solo is impossible 
But when I get up on the mic, I'm unstoppable 
And it's probably when you hear our voices laid down
You'll be bopping your head to this ill tight sound

Now I know you probably thought ya had me Played (played)
But the check is in my hand and I got it made(made)
And you'll notice my smile is like cool-aid Cause I just(just) got(got) paid(paid)

On the floor bumping to the beat
All ways sure looks sweet
Fine young lady, standin' by
Come on baby, sweet like delight
