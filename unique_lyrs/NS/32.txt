I'm feeling weak 
I cannot sleep 
My head is burning 
I feel cold down to my feet 
I want to yell  Somebody help 
Is there a cure for what I've got?  Somebody tell me 
I need your lovin' face 
I need your sweet embrace 
'cause you are my only medicine 
You drive me crazy 
Why are you messin' with my mind? 
You drive me crazy 
Why are you tellin' all these lies? 
You drive me crazy 
Stop doin' all these things to me 
You drive me crazy 
'cause all I want is to be free 
You're on my mind 
I'm so uptight 
I feel sensations from my head down to my spine 
Goin' insane 
Can't stand the pain 
Is my condition permanent somebody tell me 
I need your lovin' face 
I need your sweet embrace 
'cause you are my only medicine 
24/7 you are on my mind 
I'm goin' crazy 
You are the cure and you know but you don't care. 
Girl you're drivin me insane.... 
You can say what you want to, do what you want to. 
As long as you love me girl, I won't front you. 
You're the sweetest thing,  Lemme be your man, lemme hold your hand, or  Lemme be your friend. 
Meanwhile, we'll set the house up on the hill, 
Girl as you know, it's all about the dollar bill. 
Girl, I'll treat ya like a queen, like a lady.  Check out your clothes, 
You drive me crazy. 
You're always on my mind, 
I need you all the time 
So come and get with me, 
'cause darlin', you're the one I need.  Someone to hold me tight, 
'cause I can't sleep at night. 
You are my fantasy, 
Girl, you drive me crazy!
