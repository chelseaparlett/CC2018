Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything baby

Got laid off at your job today 
You've been working at this place for years 
And though you were underpaid 
Mami that place isn't worth your tears 
(Oh, oh)

I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away

Girl you're the best
You could be
An angel among society 
But you get crushed 
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me
(Woo)

Try to change what you can
And accept all the things you cannot 
(Don't stress yourself baby)
I know you want to fly away from the world 
But for now with the time we've got

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
 Maybe if you consider us just riding 
That once you feel like a winner 
No more crying 
And baby I know just what you need
(I know)
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea

It hurts me to watch you sing the blues 
(It hurts me baby)
Girl you're so confused 
(Let's get away)
And I know what to do

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)

Let's take a ride
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
(Let's take a ride)
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything 
Don't you want to feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

Let's take a ride
Let's go girl
Let's go girl
Let's go girl
