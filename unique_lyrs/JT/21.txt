Woke up this morning  Heard the TV sayin' something 
'Bout disaster in the world, and
It made me wonder where I'm going 
There's so much darkness in the world 
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright 
 Because if your love was all I had
In this life
Well, that would be enough  Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl Until the end of time

You've got me singing 
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Everybody sing
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Everybody singing
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Now if you're ever wondering  About the way I'm feeling 
Well, baby girl, there ain't no question 
Just to be around you is a blessing 
Sick and tired of trying to save the world 
I just want to spend my time with you, girl
And what you're give me lets me know
That we'll be alright 
 Because if your love was all I had
In this life
Well, that would be enough  Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl Until the end of time

You've got me singing 
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Everybody sing
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Everybody singing
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
