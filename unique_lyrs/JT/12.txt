Ladies and gentlemen 
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine

Yes, yes I am

And he goes by the name Justin 

All the way
From Memphis, Tennessee 
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight 
He's gonna sing a song for y'all About this girl

Come in right here?

Yeah, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl Walking down the street 
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown 
But where is it now Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my
 Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground 
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should arrive 
But you still deserve the crown 
Or hasn't it been found? Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my

Ah, ah, arms
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm 
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my

Ah, ah, arms

Ah, ah, arms

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try

You won't ever cry
