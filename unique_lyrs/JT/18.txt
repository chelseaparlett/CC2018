I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it
Don't you love it too?

Yo
Hi, I'm not here to waste your time
You know this ain't a pick up line
I just think that you're a dime
Well don't just sit there girl

Well I know that heart that's in your chest 
It carries pain and so must stress 
But you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist 
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)

I know that you want to get down
You do deserve to get down
Been working hard all week
Just trying to make your money 
Girl go on and shake your booty 
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it

I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it

By the way what's your sign
I bet it is compatible with mine Probably long lasting years down the line
I'm telling you girl you're a dime
Well don't just sit there girl

I know that heart that's in your chest 
It carries pain and so must stress 
But you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)
(Just let go)
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist 
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)

Oh...
(Remember)
Oh...
(The first time we met)
Oh...
(Butterflies in your stomach)
Oh...
(Couldn't speak)
Oh...
(You)
Oh...
(Close your eyes)
Oh...
(It's ok)
Oh...
(I was lovin' it)
Oh...

How, how you do all the things you do?
(How you do it?)
Like being you, you're so professional 
(Professional)
Not mention you're the baddest of your group 
Well don't just sit there girl

I know that you want to get down
You do deserve to get down
(Wanna get down)
Been working hard all week
(Oh, yea)
Just trying to make your money

Girl go on and shake your booty 
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it
