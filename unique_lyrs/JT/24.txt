 Listen to me

I've been around the world 
Seen a million honeys Really special girls 
Gave all my time and money 
But, there's something 'bout ya Something that's kinda funny
It's what you do to me, aw

Don't need no Maybelline 
'Cause you're a beauty queen
Don't need no L'Oreal
'Cause, bitch, you're bad as hell

If I'm a Casanova 
Then you're a supernova 
Girl, it's what you do to me
That's got me saying 

Damn, girl, you're so fine
The way you let me put it down
Girl, blows my mind
I guess I gotta put it down tonight 
I gotta put it down

Oh, oh, oh

Hey, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby, baby
You the one I've been feignin' for
When I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming of you
When you're gone, I've been screaming for ya

So why don't you be my chick and stuff 
Take you out to dinner and catch the funky stuff
Can we spend time, I'll never get enough 
You're so fine, make a dark brother blush

Got me looking like a black grape and stuff  First time saying you had me gonna crush
And if you ever give it to me
Give it to me rough 

You got me saying (you got me saying)
Got me saying damn
