I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing a girl will be there 

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?) Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?) Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you Saying you're young and confused 
Well that's a lame excuse 
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night 
Can't believe what I was hearing  Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight 
I don't think I'll spare your feelings 
You're on your own
I'm a do for me what's right 

In your eyes I see a second chance Maybe I should take another glance
But for now I'll wash my hands  Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby Pharrell say don't do it the same
But I say I ain't playing my games 
But for you my soul still remains Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby

We're gonna stop dreaming 
(The way I feel) About you

See I remember 
In December 
We were walking holding hands 
And I was your man
Can't we just get back to that?
Baby?
