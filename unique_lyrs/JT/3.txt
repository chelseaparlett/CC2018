You're sneaky 
From the corner of my eye I saw you eyeing me
I know that you're watching 
Tell me
What would you do if I encouraged you
To get next to me
When nobody's watching 

The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
Let's start our own little secrets
For just you and me to keep
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby make your move, take charge 
Show me what you got for me

Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands, (your hands) Rubbing on me
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands, (your hands) Feeling on me

If so (Girl)
If that's your hands, (your hands), then tell me what you got for me

Baby, I can tell that you want to do more
Than just dance with me
And I don't mind you flirting 
But honestly 
Do you really want to spend the whole night Passing looks at me
(Looks at me)
Come over here and get to working

Is something that makes me weak
