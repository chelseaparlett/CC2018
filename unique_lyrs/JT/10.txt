I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right 
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right 
But you gotta work that thing right for me
 Little baby with the sun dress on Looking so damn right you're wrong 
Make me want to write my own little song for you
The way the thing just wiggle in the air
Turn around and then you flip your hair
I could think of a couple positions for you

Your wasting no time talking to me
Must be something you want me to see
Well baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got Feeling lucky let me touch your spot Might be leaving with me before the night is through 

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right 
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right 
But you gotta work that thing right for me

Your body's saying things I ain't never heard
You did the shake-shake and I kinda went berserk  Gotta give it to you girl you're one of a kind
When you took my hand up so calm Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind

So baby tell me what you're doing later on
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along 
Baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got Feeling lucky let me touch your spot Might be leaving with me before the night is through 

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right 
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
(You might be right for me)

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right 
But you gotta work that thing right for me
(Yea, yea, work that thing right)

Yea, Bubba come stumblin' in
Get up huntin' 'betty' with Justin and them
We must be the fliest of southerner men
That's your girl, well buddy don't fumble it then

You better get her, I'm totally into my zone
Come on girl, close your eyes pretend it's your home
I will be puttin' my signature on
That thing I don't even want to finish the song, let's go

I'm gettin' discouraged with her
Too late now her friend, I surely prefer Listen to every word that I slur Other dudes be huggin' and nourishin' her, not me

I bet you remember the night 
Good ol' Bubba K came into her life
Test the water let me know if the temperature right Thank you ma'am, its certainly been a delight, uh-huh

I got plans tonight

But you gotta work that thing right for me

Hey, hey
So right for me
You so right for me
