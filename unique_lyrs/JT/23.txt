It's going down
Tennessee, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Three 6 Mafia 
 Tennessee 
VA, dirty south, dirty south
It's how we do what we do, man, when we do what we do Project shit what

I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right 
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight 
Now turn around, and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends, and y'all can come to the back, oh, oh

Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour glass shape you got upon that frame 
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol 
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh, oh

And when I call, don't give me the run around 
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl There ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but, girl, you don't hear me
 Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody  Little lady
Come on and don't
(Chop me up) Please don't make a fool of me
 Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody 
Easy, baby
C'mon, girl, don't
(Chop me up) Please don't make a fool of me

You're kinda cute
Baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim
Aka Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost
Do you know your way around?
If you gotta problem, baby, I can hold ya down

I can be your navigator or your compass  Better yet a genie, baby make your first wish
You the party, baby I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless 

So grab your friends and let's take it back to my house 
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
(Parental discretion is advised) Oh, oh

Y'all can be the star in my freaky spotlight Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right 
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me
 Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody  Little lady
C'mon and don't
(Chop me up) Please don't make a fool of me
 Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody 
Easy, baby
Come on, girl, don't
(Chop me up) Please don't make a fool of me

See, girl, you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags
 Harder to escape than jail cells and bills 
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails 
Like Michael Jackson, "How you do me this way?"
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia  Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee  Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey 
 Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody  Little lady
Come on and don't
(Chop me up) Please don't make a fool of me
 Little lady
You got me just
(Screwed up)
Off of your melody 
Easy, baby
Come on, girl, don't
(Chop me up) Please don't make a fool of me
 Screwed up
Chop me up Screwed up
Off of your melody 
Chop me up Please don't make a fool of me
