Would have given up my life for you Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind 
Girl, you lied straight to my face

Lookin' in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do was apologize 
You didn't say you're sorry 

I don't understand 
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me

You didn't love me enough 
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me again 
 Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine Loneliness only wants you back here with me Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do was apologize and mean it

But you didn't say you're sorry 
I don't understand 
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man

That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough 
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me

Wish like Hell I could go back in time Maybe then I could see how Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late
Its over now

You didn't say you're sorry 
I don't understand 
You don't care that you hurt me

And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough 
My heart may never mend

And you'll never get to love me again  Again 
Again, again, again  Never get to love me
