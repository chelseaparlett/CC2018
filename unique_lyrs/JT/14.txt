Sometimes (mmm) Sometimes the world gets hard
Oh na na na
I'm gonna take it from here girl
Don't you worry 

I want to be your lake, or your bay
And any problems that you have
I want to wash 'em away
I want to be your sky
So blue and high
And every time you think of me
I want to blow your mind

I want to be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe 
Ma, I'll be there 

I want to be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question 

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm a take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine  Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'm a take it from here

I want to hold your hands  Review all your plans 
I want to make sure everyone of your dreams is there 
I wanna be your Broadway show on review 
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I want to be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shiny path to help you across 
I want to be your mother, wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
'Cause I love you

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm a take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine  Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'm a take it from here

And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'm a take it from here
That's what I'm gonna do
Just as sure as the sun will shine  Every morning, every time
(Don't you worry, baby)
Don't worry, girl
I'm a take it from here

Give me one reason why we should not be leaving 
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away speeding  Through the Garden of Eden Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds 

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm a take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine  Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'm a take it from here

Give me one reason 
Why we should not be leaving 
This world is so deceiving 
The time is now
Lets fly away speeding 
(We'll fly away) Through the Garden of Eden Where all the sweet and breathing 
Of love surrounds 

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm-a take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine  Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'm-a take it from here

Love ain't always the way they write in books 
(No, no)
See there's the good guys
And also heartbreak crooks
Your hearts the real one
Just take a look inside 
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide 

So there you go
Don't worry 
To help you weather the storm 
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place 
You can always count on me
I'll take it from here
