You were my sun
You were my Earth 
But I bet you didn't know all the ways I loved you
No

So you took a chance 
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down
No

You don't have to say what you did
I already know
I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me
You're not with me
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone 

Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused 
With some other guy
The bridges were burned 
Now it's your turn to cry

Cry me a river 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river 
Yeah, yeah

You know that they say some things are better left unsaid 
But it wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it 
(Don't act like you don't know it)

All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head
You should have picked honesty
Then you might not have blown it

Yeah
You don't have to say (Don't have to say)
What you did (What you did)

Why did you leave me all alone? (All alone)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone (Baby, call me on the phone)

Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused 
With some other guy (I'm not like them, baby)
The bridges were burned 
Now it's your turn to cry (It's your turn)

Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river 
Yeah, yeah
Oh (Oh)

The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leavin' Oh (Oh)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leavin' Oh (Oh)
