The beautiful days are long gone
And I can't seem to breathe  Feels like it hasn't been that long Since you walked away from me

Now I can try to act real strong 
But you and I both know
I still think of you that way
You should know that

The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights 
They don't mean a thing 
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right  Without you here with me

Now I can try to act real strong 
But you and I both know
It's hard for me to say
You were my soul

Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same

'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain 
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel
I thought that you would never do me that way

But even after all I still think of you that way
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways

But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain 
Now love is a game that we both like to play
When I win or lose, if I go or if I stay

Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside 
Girl, you know me inside out
And I can't get you off of my mind
And I could say that I don't love you no more

And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain 
La, la, la, la
